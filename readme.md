# Purpose

Many OSINT tools require downloading and compiling from source, but you don't want to clutter up your machine. The solution? Dockerized OSINT tools that you build and run in isolated containers. Keep what you want. `docker rm` what you don't.

# How to use this repo

Each tool has its own folder wherein you'll find a `Dockerfile` and a `readme.md` with instructions.

# Prerequisites

Docker, of course. Knowing how to use it helps, too.
